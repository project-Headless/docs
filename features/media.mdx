## Using Media in Your Store

Once media is in your library (uploaded or generated), you can easily apply it to your store:

### Quick Application
1. Select any image or video from your library
2. Click "Insert to Chat"
3. Ask the AI to apply it: "Use this image as my hero banner" or "Add this video to my product page"

### Common Use Cases
- **Hero Banners**: "Apply this image as the main banner on my homepage"
- **Product Images**: "Use these images for my featured products"
- **Background Videos**: "Set this video as the background for my landing section"
- **Gallery Updates**: "Add these images to my gallery section"

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: You can select multiple images and ask the AI to create a gallery or carousel with them in one command.
