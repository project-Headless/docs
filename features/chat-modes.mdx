## Overview

The Knot chat interface is your AI-powered assistant for building and customizing your e-commerce store. You can interact with it using natural language to make changes, ask questions, and manage your store.

## Chat Modes

Knot offers two distinct modes for different types of interactions:

### Chat Mode
In Chat Mode, the AI acts as your knowledge assistant:
- Ask questions about your store's structure and functionality
- Request explanations of concepts and features
- Get examples and best practices
- **No changes are made to your store code**

### Action Mode
In Action Mode, the AI actively modifies your store:
- Make design changes (colors, layouts, typography)
- Add or remove components and features
- Update content and product displays
- Implement custom functionality
- **All changes are applied to your store in real-time**

## Reverting Changes

Made a change you don't like? No problem! Knot makes it easy to undo AI modifications:

### How to Revert
On any AI response that made changes to your store, you'll see a <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style={{display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle'}}><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 1 0 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 0-6.74 2.74L3 8"/><path d="M3 3v5h5"/></svg> **Revert this change** button.

Clicking this button will:
- Undo all changes made by that specific AI response
- Restore your store to its previous state
- Keep your chat history intact for reference

<Warning>
**Important**: Reverting an older message will also revert all subsequent changes. For example, if you revert message #3, messages #4 and #5 will also be reverted.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Pro Tips for Using the Chat Interface:**
- Be specific in your requests for better results
- Use Action Mode only when you're ready to make changes
- Preview changes in the visual editor before publishing
- Keep important changes in separate messages for easier reversion
