## Create a new project

Creating a new project is as easy as it gets with Knot. You can either use any prompt you like,
or use an image reference to create a new store.

## Steps for having your first store up and running

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add products and collections">
        Add products to your Shopify store using the Shopify admin interface or by importing a CSV file. Make sure to include product images, descriptions, and prices.
        Make sure your products are visible in your store by checking the "Headless" sales channel in Shopify.

        <Info>For detailed instructions on adding products, refer to the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify documentation</a>.</Info>

        Here is a short video on how to make products visible in your headless store:

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a new project">
        Create a new project in Knot.dev by writing a prompt like "Create a new e-commerce store" or by selecting "New Project" from the main screen.
        <Info>Example prompts can be found in the <a href="/best-practices/example-prompts">Example Prompts</a> section.</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure project settings">
        - Enter store name
        - Add a prompt if you didn't do so earlier
        - Fill in your Shopify credentials:
            - Public Access Token
            - Private Access Token
            - Store Domain (e.g., `your-store-name.myshopify.com`)
        - Upload a logo for your store (optional)
        - Pick between single or multi-page layout
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it! Give Knot a couple of minutes to generate your store,
and you'll be able to see it in the editor screen and start making changes (if you want).**
