## Getting your Admin API key And Storefront API key

<Note>
    We need both the Admin API key and Storefront API key to connect your Shopify store to Knot.dev
    the Admin Api key allows us to manage products, collections, and orders,
    while the Storefront API key enables us to fetch product data and display it on your website.
